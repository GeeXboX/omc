* check config_t struct after having read the configuration file and fill the empty items with default values in case some wouldn't have been defined by user.
* support for video player.
* OSD controls to video player.
* fix memleaks all over the application.

* correct Xine MRLs/playlist change (previous/next).
* add support for keyboard bindings (may require containers first ?)
* support for LIRC and joysticks bindings.
* do not grab all A/V file informations when entering a directory (damn slow for videos)
 => either when mouse (keyboard i.e focus) is over for a specified amount of time (using Ecore_Timer).
 => either running a thread in background when entering directory.
* do not display cover border when no cover (or when cover file grabbed from amazon is empty).
* find a way to handle text_blocks alpha level (used in notifier).
* grab DVD covers from Amazon for movie-type browser.

* add playdir button in audio menu to add all files from browser to playlist.
* add new widget check box.
* add new widget progress bar to show loading.
* fix browser elements and display calculation.
* add image browser :
 => should display thumbnails of images from current dir.
 => use generic .thumbnails directory ?
 => use EFL Epsilon library or not ?
 => should display generic temporary picture until the thumbnail is ready to be displayed.
 => do we display filename below thumbnail or not (it will anyhow be required for directories).
* add image viewer screen with some buttons/utilities like :
 => previous/next
 => start diaporama
 => zoom in/out
 => move up/down/left/right
 => keep 1:1 aspect ratio or maximized pictures where w/h < screenw/screenh
* add support for popups (should keep focus over all other elements).
* add new button in audio player screen for :
 => loop on/off
 => shuffle on/off
 => use mouse right button on playlist element to remove from list
 => support for a "Jump to ..." popup.
* add a screen for file management ?
 => 2 browsers to copy/move files from a location (CD ?) to another (HDD ?)
 => add file(s) to disc and burn it ? (libisofs and libburn)
 => vobcopy DVD to HDD ?
* support for internationalization (not gettext !! as not supported by uClibc)
 => extra XML file (as with MPUI) with predefined IDs (like for fonts support)
 => should support runtime langage switch.
* use Curl function to avoid trying fecthing HTTP URLs if no Internet connection's available.
* more generic player bindings (player bindings should _ONLY_ be in player.{h,c} i.e no xine_* in other files) to be able to support other players than Xine (MPlayer, GStreamer, VLC ...) in a near future.
* add a OMC default/generic cover for video/audio files that do not have one.
* all objects x/y coords should be % and not static for better resolution change.
* support for fullscreen switch :
 => may imply runtime resize of all objects
 => or simply change omc->w and omc->h values and update screens.
* directly uses libogg/mp3/flac to retrieves metadatas from audio files (Xine seems to only be able to grab infos from MP3 files).
* grab EXIF metdata from JPEG files ?
* directly uses libpng/libjpeg/... to retrieve infos from image files ?
* find a place where days last 48h to have time to finish it some day.
